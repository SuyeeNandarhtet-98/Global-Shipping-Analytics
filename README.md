### OverView Finding


This project involved creating a dynamic Monthly Sales Analysis Dashboard that provides a clear and actionable overview of key business metrics. The dashboard was designed to assist decision-makers in tracking sales performance, identifying trends, and optimizing strategies based on data-driven insights.

The analysis focused on several critical performance indicators:

Revenue reached $1.35 million, with Net Sales totaling $1.27 million. A total of 51,000 units were sold across 830 orders, reflecting strong sales volume.

A central feature of the dashboard is the Monthly Revenue Chart, which compares sales data from the current year to the previous year. This comparison allows for quick identification of growth patterns and seasonal trends, enabling strategic planning based on year-over-year performance.

The dashboard also includes insights into the Top Seller Categories, showcasing the best-performing product categories. This information helps in identifying high-demand products and focusing marketing efforts on the most profitable areas.

An analysis of Average Freight Costs by Company provides a breakdown of shipping expenses, allowing for better negotiation with logistics providers and cost optimization in the supply chain.

Additionally, the dashboard highlights the Most Shipped Products, offering a clear view of items with the highest shipping frequency, which aids in inventory and supply chain management.
